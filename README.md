## Basler Blaze-101 3D Camera URDF Description for ROS

This repository contains the URDF and 3D mesh files necessary to integrate the Basler Blaze-101 Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera into a ROS-based robot model, specifically designed for Clearpath Husky A200 but can be adapted to other robots.

## Overview

- **Robot model integration**: Allows visualization of the Blaze-101 camera directly in RViz, linked properly to the robot's TF tree.
- **Custom 3D mesh**: Includes a detailed `.dae` model of the Blaze-101 for accurate rendering.
- **URDF/Xacro macros**: Easy to include and position on custom robot URDFs.
